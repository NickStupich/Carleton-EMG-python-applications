Note - should have the "Carleton-EMG-python-computer-code" folder in your python path so that these applications can access the classification / interpolation / training programs 

Additional dependencies:
Pyserial - for the bluetooth communication to the microcontroller.  Not actually for this module, but for the Carleton-EMG-python-computer code project.  Available at:
http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/
